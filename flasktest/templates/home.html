    <h2> About </h2>
    <p> The Center for Public History (a made up organization) has received 
      a grant to create an app for our New York City Oral History initiative. 
      We are now looking for developers to create an app that lets people 
      record and publish Oral Histories of themselves, family friends, the 
      guy from the corner store, etc., and make them public on our website. 
      The app will also allow users the option to upload things like photos 
      and documents that help flesh out their stories, and the ability to 
      handle sure that we have all the right permissions and legal. Not only 
      will this help build the historical record, but also give people a 
      chance to record and organize their own personal collections to share 
      with friends and family online on the centerâ€™s website. </p>
    
    <p> Since we are receiving government funds and to keep in the spirit of
      transparency and in making information available, all source code will
      be make public and instructions created to give other organizations
      the chance to use this tool in their own project. Due to the state of
      the GLAM field and the constant technology and resource gap, for the
      app to be effective, it will also need to be lightweight and simple to
      set up. </p>
