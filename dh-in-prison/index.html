            <p> "Introduction to Digital Humanities" aims to introduce students to the landscape of digital humanities tools and methods through readings and classroom and online discussions, hands-on workshops, and collaborative projects. Students will explore a broad range of ways to critically evaluate and incorporate digital technologies into academic research and learn to design and build websites, apps, maps, and games, and visualize data. Students will learn some Python, html, css, and other programming languages as needed. In addition, they will have explored both the general field and a particular area of digital scholarship and/or pedagogy of interest to them, produced a digital project in collaboration with fellow students, and learned how to present their digital work effectively.</p>

            <p> The Prison to College Pipeline (P2CP) at John Jay College of Criminal Justice Reentry Institute represents a dynamic partnership between two major public institutions: the New York State Department of Corrections and Community Supervision (DOCCS) and CUNY, a public university system with a rich history of providing quality education to typically underserved communities. Since 2011, P2CP has been delivering classes at the Otisville Correctional Facility, a medium security state menâ€™s institution approximately two hours from New York City.</p>
