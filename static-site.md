CALL FOR PROGRAMMERS

Do you want to leap into the exciting world of html or Jekyll to build a static site for a meaningful cause? Here is an opportunity to use and develop your programming skills and have fun working in a team.

Description
I need to build a static site for a module of a digital humanities course to be taught in prison. This site will be used by students to access course content and communicate with each other. The lesson on the static site I need you to build will teach students how to build a static site. The site will contain about five pages which may include:

course introduction and syllabus
reading on building websites as humanities research
discussion board
step by step tutorial for building a static site
resources for student site content

Requirements
The software will need to work without an internet connection. It should be possible for a class of 10-15 students and the instructor to view the site on individual laptops at the same time and contribute to the discussion board. The resources for student site content might include images, text files and maybe videos, keeping in mind that students wonâ€™t have access to the internet to look for content for their sites. If, however, linking a lot of data to the site is not feasible at this point, this page can be rethought or trashed.

About this project
The static site I want to build is part of my capstone project, which is to design and develop an undergraduate college-level course in digital humanities and digital skills to be taught in prison. The goals of this course are to help students empower themselves through study of the humanities, learn technical skills that will be useful for reentry and develop critical skills that will be useful for future intellectual pursuits. I am developing this course through minimal computing because very few prison college programs offer digital skills or digital humanities courses due to a scarcity of hard and soft infrastructure to support digital work and because incarcerated people are generally forbidden access to the internet.
