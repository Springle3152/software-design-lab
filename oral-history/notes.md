Next steps:

goal: figure out a sequence of code to put an audio file that can be archived to another page.

Before 4/3: build the add history page

code input for name, date, location, contact, etc. (I think we might need Python - or can we do this in html?)

we have a bunch of questions for Thomas. We should list more. One question is, do you see the user uploading various files only once or do you want the user to be able to edit their oral history or add to the archive they've created?

Conversation with Thomas wed 4-10-19

Think of it as a platform where people go – historian enthusiasts – people might want to go around the neighborhood collecting stories – history enthusiasts – ideally audio, text, images 

User accounts – imagine five users (then he said scratch that) – each person has their own account – uploading over time – 

If we want to get into sql – we’ll need sql – list of fields – on sql for public use or private – 

Would rather we document it well and tell someone else how to set it up – not center creates project people can use it but how to download it from git and how to run it on the computer – windows mac issues –
