Next steps:

goal: figure out a sequence of code to put an audio file that can be archived to another page.

Before 4/3: build the add history page

code input for name, date, location, contact, etc. (I think we might need Python - or can we do this in html?)

we have a bunch of questions for Thomas. We should list more. One question is, do you see the user uploading various files only once or do you want the user to be able to edit their oral history or add to the archive they've created?
