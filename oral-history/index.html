            <p> The Center for Public History is a New York organization dedicated to
                the development of history that is accessible to everyone. Our goal is
                to promote awareness of issues in the museum, archives and education
                fields and to provide resources that help professionals in those
                fields reach and interact with the public more effectively. We are
                strongly committed to the openness of information and reducing
                barriers of entry to those who wish to access or promote history.</p>
