# Sabina's Course Goals

## Goal One: spec a reentry app for formerly incarcerated people or an app for people in recovery from chemical dependency or who use mind-altering substances and want to stop using these or who want to continue using these in a safe and reasonable way


-----

Benchmark: Write a clear and detailed description of this app which would allow a developer to know exactly how I envision the app and what the app is supposed to do. In this description I might need to draw the tree and branches of the app.  


## Goal Two: Understand how Rikersbot works

-----

Benchmark: I'm not sure what the benchmark could be. A longish somewhat techy blog post explaining how Rikersbot was used on Rikers Island by Dennis Tenen?

## Goal Three: Design and build a website on a 100-dollar Lenovo laptop

-----

Benchmark: Build it. Offline. Then Push it and publish it. Yay. Ha.
