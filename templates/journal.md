# Sabina's Technical Journal

## Week Two (1/30 to 2/6)

The first week, I did most of the DHRI Command Line tutorial up to and not including Pipes. I spent an inexplicably long time trying to clone software-lab tutorial from Patrick's repository, then forked it to my repository and tried to clone it from there, to no avail. I still don't know why I didn't manage to clone software-lab. I followed the steps carefully again and again. Happily, I was able to clone software-lab in class on the second week with Antonio's help but by typing what I think were the exact same commands. 

Hour 1: DHRI Command Line tutorial

Hour 2: Tried to clone software-lab repository in terminal, unsuccessfully. Read and followed lots of instructions from various sources

Hour 3: DHRI Command Line tutorial. 

Hour 4: Tried to clone software-lab repository in terminal again. Downloaded newest version of Visual Studio Code. Forked software-lab to my Github account, thinking that maybe I would be able to clone it to terminal from there. Tried to clone my forked copy of software-lab to terminal. Unsuccessful

Hour 5: DHRI Command Line tutorial. Lost files I had created in terminal by deleting them in Desktop from the front end. Got rather confused and decided to stay away from the front end.

Hour 6: Tried to clone software-lab repository in terminal again. Got really frustrated. Decided to ask someone for help on Tuesday.

Hour 7: Set out to finish the DHRI Command Line tutorial but my brain was sluggish and dull and I kept going over the same exercises and getting them wrong, so I stopped.

Note: I'm trying to commit this journal to GitHub. I'm a little confused. 

## Week Three (2/7 to 2/13)

Doing the GCDI Git tutorial, I was nonplussed by observing that when I typed git config –list, instead of seeing my git user name and user email, I saw a huge list of really interesting looking stuff, such as core.legacyheaders=false and color.interactive=auto. Instead of the $ there was a : and I couldn’t type cd ~ to get back to the beginning. I hit return and more strange words and symbols appeared. I hit return again, and more, and more and so on, until I saw, at the bottom of that great list, my user name, user email and (END). Yay. How cool is that. I have tons of stuff. However, I can’t get back to where I can type commands. I decide to close terminal and hope that when I open it again I can start fresh. Yeah. That worked. As I work through the tutorial I do things that we did in class last Tuesday. This is great because it reinforces what I learned (and partially forgot). I have to stop myself from speedreading the tutorial; I have the impulse to say oh yeah I know that, we did that, and miss key steps. I have to plod along and do everything. It’s therapeutic. I have to keep it easy and simple. There’s no hurry. The important thing is that I sit here for three hours doing stuff. I discovered common exit commands to return to $ prompt. 

Hour 1: DHRI Git tutorial

Hour 2: DHRI Git tutorial and tried to add journal.md to GitHub

Hour 3: continued to try to push journal.md to GitHub and succeeded. Updated goals.md. 

Hour 4: Command line crash course from Learn Python the Hard Way. I had started Learn Python the Hard Way, and in lesson 0 Zed Shaw told me to do his command line crash course before going any further. Although I had done more than half of the DHRI command line tutorial (up to Pipes), I thought it best to do Zed Shaw's command line crash course from beginning to end too. 

Hour 5: Command line crash course from Learn Python the Hard Way

Hour 6: Command line crash course from Learn Python the Hard Way

Hour 7: Learn Python the Hard Way, lessons 1-3 

Hour 8: Learn Python the Hard Way, lessons 4-5

Hour 9: Learn Python the Hard Way, lesson 6

## Week Four (2/14 to 2/20)

One of the things I have to do this week is tidy up my directories. I have two projects directories; one is in Desktop and the other is somewhere else. Both have files in them, but not the same files. I'm going to move and then remove files, but I'll do this tonight or tomorrow. 

Hour 1: modified goals and journal, and pushed both to the repository. Explained to one of my classmates how to modify files in code and then push modified files to a repository. Googled how to move files from one directory to another. Tried to do it. It didn't work.

Hour 2: did exercise six in Learn Python 3 the Hard Way. I had done Exercise 6 in Learn Python 2 the Hard Way but making strings and variables in Python 3 following instructions from the Python 2 book hadn't worked. With the Python 3 book it was easy peasy. Then I decided to give moving files between directories another try. I consulted Zed Shaw's command line crash course. I'm confused because moving files isn't really moving them, it's renaming them. I have to ask Patrick about this. Because moving was confusing, I copied instead. I copied a bunch of files from Users/sabinapringle to Users/sabinapringle/projects/ and then removed the files in Users/sabinapringle. I know there has to be a better way. I want to move stuff, not copy stuff or rename stuff. And I want to move a bunch of files at once. I know I can use wildcards but when I tried it didn't work. I can copy files but I don't think I know how to copy directories. I could figure all this stuff out but I think this time I might ask a digital fellow for help, because I prefer to move on with the exercises in Learn Python the Hard Way.

Hour 3: wow I did something really weird and got kind of stuck in the middle of committing my journal. I couldn't figure out how to get back to the $ sign (exit commands I know didn't work) so I closed Terminal. When I went back in I tried to commit again and I got a scary error message telling me that there was a process running and I had to remove a swap - I think it was swap - file.
The thing I had to do was vim -r /Users/sabinapringle/Desktop/projects/software-design-lab/.git/COMMIT_EDITMSG 

Hour 4: Learn Python the Hard Way, exx 7-10

## Week Five (2/21 to 2/27)

This week sucked in twenty-seven ways because I had twenty-seven student papers to grade. It didn't suck because the papers sucked; a lot of them were pretty good; the week sucked because grading those papers took me all darn weekend and I didn't have much time to do anything else. I did get some reading done, though, and I installed Jekyll, and I think I wrote and ran something in Jekyll, following a tutorial I google-found, but I don't really know what I did. It was fun, though, whatever it was. I also went to the digital fellows' office hours on Monday and got great help from Javier understanding what I can do with HTML.

I had read "FSF: What Is Free Software?" and "The Cathedral and the Bazaar" for week three because I got my weeks mixed up and thought we were in week four last week. I therefore hadn't read the accessibility readings for week three and felt really bad in class because I'm super interested in accessibiity and know it's really important. I couldn't contribute to the discussion last week because I hadn't read the stuff. Grrrr. Sorry. HowEVer, I read "How People with Disabilities Use the Web: Tools and Techniques (W3C)" and "Dear Developer, The Web Isn't About You" (I LOVED "Dear Developer"! I kept laughing out loud :)) and now I'm very on top of the readings. For next week I'll read "Two Bit History: The World Wide Web and Its Inventor" and "Free as in Freedom" and will be able to talk a lot in class. 

I didn't do any Python. Not good. I have to do a little every day, or I won't learn. I'm going to do some now. 

Hour 1: caught up with reading (I don't think catching up with reading should go in this technical journal but I'll make an exception this week)

Hour 2: caught up with reading

Hour 3: caught up with reading

Hour 4: installed Jekyll

Hour 5: did strange Jekyll tutorial I found on the web and might have built something

Hour 6: hung out with digital fellows in their office hours and javier helped me understand that I can build websites in HTML offline and see them offline (I think I understood this - I'll double check with you) and now I totally see how the setup for teaching coding in prison will be. I'm really excited about this. 

Hour 7: Learn Python the Hard Way exx 11-12. It seems to me that if from the command line I create a new file called ex10.py and ex10.py already exists, nothing happens. I don't get a message asking me if I want to replace the file. Nor is ex10.py replaced or duplicated. It simply isn't created. I'll ask someone if my understanding is correct. I don't understand what pydoc is. I looked it up in https://docs.python.org/2/library/pydoc.html but I still don't understand. According to this website pydoc is a module but I'm not sure what a module is in python. Pydoc "automatically generates documentation from Python modules. The documentation can be presented as pages of text on the console, served to a Web browser, or saved to HTML files." Hm. Duh. No comprendo.

Hour 8: ha! Comprendo a little more. I did ex13.py and created argument variables and understand that sys is a module. It's still a hazy comprehension that I have; rather, it's a glimmer in the darkness, a promise of more light to come. :)

## Week Six (2/28 to 3/6)

I didn’t do any Learn Python the Hard Way this week. This really bugs me. However, the reason I didn’t do any Python is because I chose to do the reading instead. I loved reading Free as in Freedom. I didn’t need to read it because I’d read The Cathedral and the Bazar, which I also enjoyed very much. I had read FSF: What is free software the week before. I was thrilled with copyleft. Ha. Such a good idea. And I totally get the difference between open source and free source. These are really important fundamental concepts and I’m glad that I made the decision to do all that reading rather than work on learning to code. In a perfect world I should have been able to do both, but due to the imperfect nature of my current existence, time was not abundant enough.
I’m not going to list the hours reading, but instead note that I spent many hours reading and going off on reading-connected tangents.  

## Week Seven (3/7 to 3/13)

From the reading for today I learned that Python does imperative programming. It works in steps and often changes the state of the program by introducing new variables and/or changing existing variables. Functional programs, on the other hand, avoid states as much as they can. This is a wild concept. Not sure how I picture this. If I understand correctly a functional program sees the paradigm as a problem and comes up with a solution. Solutions are functions “that pass values to one another.” I don’t see what values are as opposed to variables. What is the difference between variables in an imperative program and values in a functional program? 
In a functional program the question of the state of the program tends to be isolated. The functions, which pass values from one to another, seek to be predictable. These functions should always produce the same output if fed the same input. 
Object-oriented programming is a combination of imperative and functional programming. It designates functions that deal with specific states. Objects are a combination of state (or the data that describes the state) with the functions that act on the state. The object-oriented approach tells specific functions to only operate on specific pieces of data.

Hour 1: Oh man. I hadn’t been on the command line for a while and I went to files on the first level of my user if you see what I mean (I have to figure out where these files are from the front end) and opened software-design-lab/templates/journal.md to update my journal and found only the first two weeks. Oh argh. I wondered if I’d deleted most of my journal and was about to fetch and merge it from my repository but then thought maybe I should look on Desktop to see if it’s there and argh, voila, I have another software-design-lab in Desktop/projects where journal.md is updated. So I started removing files in the other software-design-lab folder with the rm command but then got a bit scared because I was removing a lot of stuff one by one (I’m scared of using rm –R). I think I’ll ask for help with deleting stuff. 

Hour 2: I read the homework (“An Introduction to Programming”), downloaded the zip file and put this file in Desktop/software-design-lab. I typed in the prompts and ran them but I don’t understand why I did what I did. 

Hour 3: Re-read An Introduction to Programming. I still don't understand. I feel very dull-witted. I'll hopefully have a eureka I can see the light moment in class. For now I'm putting this aside and going to do some soothing Learn Python the Hard Way. 

## Week Eight

Wow. Week eight already. I'm turning over a new leaf. This week we will see many hours of hacking documented in this journal. 

Hour 1: I looked back over the exercises I've done in Learn Python the Hard Way to refresh my memory and decided to do ex13 again because I must have been tired when I did it; I don't think I absorbed much. I found that I didn't understand some of the terminology. I looked up sys with pydoc and see that sys is system-specific parameters. I understand that sys is a module, and that there are lots of different modular variations. In ex13 I use the sys command to import an argument variable to my script from the system-specific parameters. I am importing this from what Zed Shaw calls the Python feature set, which I understand is or is in the system-specific parameters, to my script, which is my code. My script is in my argument, which is my file named ex13.py. The command line - or, rather, Python 3.7 run through the command line - is the interpreter. The argv which I am importing holds the arguments I pass on to my script. I unpack it and assign argv to four variables. Ah, uh oh. Zed Shaw tells me that what he calls features are really called modules. I kind of understand why he does this. A feature is more imaginable than a module, which could be many things. But OK, got it, features are modules. 
I spent a disproportionate amount of time trying to figure out why my argument wouldn't run, googled the error I was getting, went back and realized I had forgotten to pass three variables to my argument when I ran my script. Duh. Anyway, now it's running and I understand much better what I'm doing than when I first did ex13. Just one thing though: a word in my ex13.py shows up with a red squiggly underline. When I hover I read Possible unbalanced tuple unpacking with sequence: left side has 4 label(s), right side has 0 value(s)pylint(unbalanced-tuple-unpacking). The argument runs anyway (am I right to talk about "running" my "argument"?) but I wonder why I get the red squiggly underline and what the explanation means.

Hour 2: did ex14. Love it! Super cool how I created an argument with variables and prompts and got input from a user (myself) with argv. Zed Shaw says that I should make sure I understand how he combined a """style multiline string with the {} format activator as the last print. I understand that he did it but I'm not sure what it does. I have to ask you what I'm doing. Did ex15. Wowee. I actually got Python to open a txt file! Super thrilling. This opens up a world of possibilities. I did pydoc open as ZS told me to, and my head is spinning with all the new concepts condensed into the brief pydoc explanation of what open does. 

Hour 3: Learn Python the Hard Way (LPTHW from now on) ex16. I need to remember that write takes a parameter of a string I want to write to a file. Ha! I read and wrote into a file from the command line! Ha! This is awesome. I can open files in the command line and alter them. I'm hacking. :) Looking back at the code I wrote, I'm not sure what target does. I know that I give a file a command by using the . (dot or period), the name of the command, and parameters, so when I write target.write(line1) I'm telling the target file (I think the target file is the file I opened when I ran ex16.py) to write line 1 of the file I just truncated. And target.write("\n") tells the target file to write a new line. After ex16 I did ex17, where I open a file and copy its contents to another file. To my delight it worked beautifully. I'm just a little confused because the first time I ran it the output file, which doesn't exist, is new_file.txt and the argument correctly returned False because it doesn't exist. When I tried running the code with another input file but the same output new_file.txt the argument said that True the file does exist. Hm. I have to go back over this. 

Hour 4: LPTHW ex18. Now Zed Shaw introduces us to functions. I think functions might not be exactly the same thing as modules after all. I did ex18 with no problem whatsoever. Then I did ex19. It won't run. Nothing happens. It drives me nuts. I went over it again and again, no syntax errors. I exited terminal and went back. It won't run. I did cat ex19.py and everything looks right. I googled the problem with ex19, haven't found an answer so far. 

Hour 5: I went to digital fellow office hours to ask for help with ex19.py. Digital fellows is packed today. So I couldn't get help from anyone because all the fellows are busy. I have to rush to class. 

## Week Nine

I was supposed to recover from oral surgery in the four days following 3/14 and I suppose I did, but as I was doing so I got a big infection in the root of another tooth and it was really painful, but I thought it was the post-surgery trauma that was hurting and didn’t realize I had a massive infection until 3/25 when I went to the dentist for post-surgery follow-up. Due to this infection I have been finding it difficult to stay on top of things. The good news is that it’s over, gone, done with. My dentist extracted the infected tooth on 3/25 and I’ve been feeling myself again since then. 

This is my journal entry for last week. I’m sorry to be posting it late. Basically, all I did this past week was the SQL tutorial, which was a lot of fun; SQL seems somewhat intuitive when one gets used to its syntax, but at the same time it feels a bit clunky, maybe because it’s been around since the ‘70s. 

Hour 1: W3Schools Tutorial on SQL

Hour 2: W3Schools Tutorial on SQL

Hour 3: figured out how to push my project description assignment to GitHub as a new .md file, and put it on GitHub

I’m afraid that was it for this week. I’ll have more to say in next week’s journal.
