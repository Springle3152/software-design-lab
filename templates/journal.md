# $Sabina's Technical Journal

## Week Two (1/30 to 2/6)

The first week, I did most of the DHRI Command Line tutorial up to and not including Pipes. I spent an inexplicably long time trying to clone software-lab tutorial from Patrick's repository, then forked it to my repository and tried to clone it from there, to no avail. I still don't know why I didn't manage to clone software-lab. I followed the steps carefully again and again. Happily, I was able to clone software-lab in class on the second week with Antonio's help but by typing what I think were the exact same commands. 

Hour 1: DHRI Command Line tutorial

Hour 2: Tried to clone software-lab repository in terminal, unsuccessfully. Read and followed lots of instructions from various sources

Hour 3: DHRI Command Line tutorial. 

Hour 4: Tried to clone software-lab repository in terminal again. Downloaded newest version of Visual Studio Code. Forked software-lab to my Github account, thinking that maybe I would be able to clone it to terminal from there. Tried to clone my forked copy of software-lab to terminal. Unsuccessful

Hour 5: DHRI Command Line tutorial. Lost files I had created in terminal by deleting them in Desktop from the front end. Got rather confused and decided to stay away from the front end.

Hour 6: Tried to clone software-lab repository in terminal again. Got really frustrated. Decided to ask someone for help on Tuesday.

Hour 7: Set out to finish the DHRI Command Line tutorial but my brain was sluggish and dull and I kept going over the same exercises and getting them wrong, so I stopped.

Note: I'm trying to commit this journal to GitHub. I'm a little confused. 

## Week Three (2/7 to 2/13)

Doing the GCDI Git tutorial, I was nonplussed by observing that when I typed git config –list, instead of seeing my git user name and user email, I saw a huge list of really interesting looking stuff, such as core.legacyheaders=false and color.interactive=auto. Instead of the $ there was a : and I couldn’t type cd ~ to get back to the beginning. I hit return and more strange words and symbols appeared. I hit return again, and more, and more and so on, until I saw, at the bottom of that great list, my user name, user email and (END). Yay. How cool is that. I have tons of stuff. However, I can’t get back to where I can type commands. I decide to exit terminal and hope that when I open it again I can start fresh. Yeah. That worked. As I work through the tutorial I do things that we did in class last Tuesday. This is great because it reinforces what I learned (and partially forgot). I have to stop myself from speedreading the tutorial; I have the impulse to say oh yeah I know that, we did that, and miss key steps. I have to plod along and do everything. It’s therapeutic. I have to keep it easy and simple. There’s no hurry. The important thing is that I sit here for three hours doing stuff. I discovered common exit commands to return to $ prompt. 

Hour 1: DHRI Git tutorial

Hour 2: DHRI Git tutorial and tried to add journal.md to GitHub

Hour 3: continued to try to push journal.md to GitHub and succeeded. Updated goals.md.
