# $Sabina's Technical Journal

## Week Two (1/30 to 2/6)

The first week, I did most of the DHRI Command Line tutorial up to and not including Pipes. I spent an inexplicably long time trying to clone software-lab tutorial from Patrick's repository, then forked it to my repository and tried to clone it from there, to no avail. I still don't know why I didn't manage to clone software-lab. I followed the steps carefully again and again. Happily, I was able to clone software-lab in class on the second week with Antonio's help but by typing what I think were the exact same commands. 

Hour 1: DHRI Command Line tutorial
Hour 2: Tried to clone software-lab repository in terminal, unsuccessfully. Read and followed lots of instructions from various sources
Hour 3: DHRI Command Line tutorial. 
Hour 4: Tried to clone software-lab repository in terminal again. Downloaded newest version of Visual Studio Code. Forked software-lab to my Github account, thinking that maybe I would be able to clone it to terminal from there. Tried to clone my forked copy of software-lab to terminal. Unsuccessful
Hour 5: DHRI Command Line tutorial. Lost files I had created in terminal by deleting them in Desktop from the front end. Got rather confused and decided to stay away from the front end.
Hour 6: Tried to clone software-lab repository in terminal again. Got really frustrated. Decided to ask someone for help on Tuesday.
Hour 7: Set out to finish the DHRI Command Line tutorial but my brain was sluggish and dull and I kept going over the same exercises and getting them wrong, so I stopped.
