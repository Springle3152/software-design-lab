# Sabina's Technical Journal

## Week Two (1/30 to 2/6)

The first week, I did most of the DHRI Command Line tutorial up to and not including Pipes. I spent an inexplicably long time trying to clone software-lab tutorial from Patrick's repository, then forked it to my repository and tried to clone it from there, to no avail. I still don't know why I didn't manage to clone software-lab. I followed the steps carefully again and again. Happily, I was able to clone software-lab in class on the second week with Antonio's help but by typing what I think were the exact same commands. 

Hour 1: DHRI Command Line tutorial

Hour 2: Tried to clone software-lab repository in terminal, unsuccessfully. Read and followed lots of instructions from various sources

Hour 3: DHRI Command Line tutorial. 

Hour 4: Tried to clone software-lab repository in terminal again. Downloaded newest version of Visual Studio Code. Forked software-lab to my Github account, thinking that maybe I would be able to clone it to terminal from there. Tried to clone my forked copy of software-lab to terminal. Unsuccessful

Hour 5: DHRI Command Line tutorial. Lost files I had created in terminal by deleting them in Desktop from the front end. Got rather confused and decided to stay away from the front end.

Hour 6: Tried to clone software-lab repository in terminal again. Got really frustrated. Decided to ask someone for help on Tuesday.

Hour 7: Set out to finish the DHRI Command Line tutorial but my brain was sluggish and dull and I kept going over the same exercises and getting them wrong, so I stopped.

Note: I'm trying to commit this journal to GitHub. I'm a little confused. 

## Week Three (2/7 to 2/13)

Doing the GCDI Git tutorial, I was nonplussed by observing that when I typed git config –list, instead of seeing my git user name and user email, I saw a huge list of really interesting looking stuff, such as core.legacyheaders=false and color.interactive=auto. Instead of the $ there was a : and I couldn’t type cd ~ to get back to the beginning. I hit return and more strange words and symbols appeared. I hit return again, and more, and more and so on, until I saw, at the bottom of that great list, my user name, user email and (END). Yay. How cool is that. I have tons of stuff. However, I can’t get back to where I can type commands. I decide to close terminal and hope that when I open it again I can start fresh. Yeah. That worked. As I work through the tutorial I do things that we did in class last Tuesday. This is great because it reinforces what I learned (and partially forgot). I have to stop myself from speedreading the tutorial; I have the impulse to say oh yeah I know that, we did that, and miss key steps. I have to plod along and do everything. It’s therapeutic. I have to keep it easy and simple. There’s no hurry. The important thing is that I sit here for three hours doing stuff. I discovered common exit commands to return to $ prompt. 

Hour 1: DHRI Git tutorial

Hour 2: DHRI Git tutorial and tried to add journal.md to GitHub

Hour 3: continued to try to push journal.md to GitHub and succeeded. Updated goals.md. 

Hour 4: Command line crash course from Learn Python the Hard Way. I had started Learn Python the Hard Way, and in lesson 0 Zed Shaw told me to do his command line crash course before going any further. Although I had done more than half of the DHRI command line tutorial (up to Pipes), I thought it best to do Zed Shaw's command line crash course from beginning to end too. 

Hour 5: Command line crash course from Learn Python the Hard Way

Hour 6: Command line crash course from Learn Python the Hard Way

Hour 7: Learn Python the Hard Way, lessons 1-3 

Hour 8: Learn Python the Hard Way, lessons 4-5

Hour 9: Learn Python the Hard Way, lesson 6

## Week Four (2/14 to 2/20)

One of the things I have to do this week is tidy up my directories. I have two projects directories; one is in Desktop and the other is somewhere else. Both have files in them, but not the same files. I'm going to move and then remove files, but I'll do this tonight or tomorrow. 

Hour 1: modified goals and journal, and pushed both to the repository. Explained to one of my classmates how to modify files in code and then push modified files to a repository. Googled how to move files from one directory to another. Tried to do it. It didn't work.

Hour 2: did exercise six in Learn Python 3 the Hard Way. I had done Exercise 6 in Learn Python 2 the Hard Way but making strings and variables in Python 3 following instructions from the Python 2 book hadn't worked. With the Python 3 book it was easy peasy. Then I decided to give moving files between directories another try. I consulted Zed Shaw's command line crash course. I'm confused because moving files isn't really moving them, it's renaming them. I have to ask Patrick about this. Because moving was confusing, I copied instead. I copied a bunch of files from Users/sabinapringle to Users/sabinapringle/projects/ and then removed the files in Users/sabinapringle. I know there has to be a better way. I want to move stuff, not copy stuff or rename stuff. And I want to move a bunch of files at once. I know I can use wildcards but when I tried it didn't work. I can copy files but I don't think I know how to copy directories. I could figure all this stuff out but I think this time I might ask a digital fellow for help, because I prefer to move on with the exercises in Learn Python the Hard Way.

Hour 3: wow I did something really weird and got kind of stuck in the middle of committing my journal. I couldn't figure out how to get back to the $ sign (exit commands I know didn't work) so I closed Terminal. When I went back in I tried to commit again and I got a scary error message telling me that there was a process running and I had to remove a swap - I think it was swap - file.
The thing I had to do was vim -r /Users/sabinapringle/Desktop/projects/software-design-lab/.git/COMMIT_EDITMSG 

Hour 4: Learn Python the Hard Way, exx 7-10

## Week Five (2/21 to 2/27)

This week sucked in twenty-seven ways because I had twenty-seven student papers to grade. It didn't suck because the papers sucked; a lot of them were pretty good; the week sucked because grading those papers took me all darn weekend and I didn't have much time to do anything else. I did get some reading done, though, and I installed Jekyll, and I think I wrote and ran something in Jekyll, following a tutorial I google-found, but I don't really know what I did. It was fun, though, whatever it was. I also went to the digital fellows' office hours on Monday and got great help from Javier understanding what I can do with HTML.

I had read "FSF: What Is Free Software?" and "The Cathedral and the Bazaar" for week three because I got my weeks mixed up and thought we were in week four last week. I therefore hadn't read the accessibility readings for week three and felt really bad in class because I'm super interested in accessibiity and know it's really important. I couldn't contribute to the discussion last week because I hadn't read the stuff. Grrrr. Sorry. HowEVer, I read "How People with Disabilities Use the Web: Tools and Techniques (W3C)" and "Dear Developer, The Web Isn't About You" (I LOVED "Dear Developer"! I kept laughing out loud :)) and now I'm very on top of the readings. For next week I'll read "Two Bit History: The World Wide Web and Its Inventor" and "Free as in Freedom" and will be able to talk a lot in class. 

I didn't do any Python. Not good. I have to do a little every day, or I won't learn. I'm going to do some now. 

Hour 1: caught up with reading (I don't think catching up with reading should go in this technical journal but I'll make an exception this week)

Hour 2: caught up with reading

Hour 3: caught up with reading

Hour 4: installed Jekyll

Hour 5: did strange Jekyll tutorial I found on the web and might have built something

Hour 6: hung out with digital fellows in their office hours and javier helped me understand that I can build websites in HTML offline and see them offline (I think I understood this - I'll double check with you) and now I totally see how the setup for teaching coding in prison will be. I'm really excited about this. 

Hour 7: Learn Python the Hard Way exx 11-12. It seems to me that if from the command line I create a new file called ex10.py and ex10.py already exists, nothing happens. I don't get a message asking me if I want to replace the file. Nor is ex10.py replaced or duplicated. It simply isn't created. I'll ask someone if my understanding is correct. I don't understand what pydoc is. I looked it up in https://docs.python.org/2/library/pydoc.html but I still don't understand. According to this website pydoc is a module but I'm not sure what a module is in python. Pydoc "automatically generates documentation from Python modules. The documentation can be presented as pages of text on the console, served to a Web browser, or saved to HTML files." Hm. Duh. No comprendo.

Hour 8: ha! Comprendo a little more. I did ex13.py and created argument variables and understand that sys is a module. It's still a hazy comprehension that I have; rather, it's a glimmer in the darkness, a promise of more light to come. :)

## Week Six (2/28 to 3/6)

I didn’t do any Learn Python the Hard Way this week. This really bugs me. However, the reason I didn’t do any Python is because I chose to do the reading instead. I loved reading Free as in Freedom. I didn’t need to read it because I’d read The Cathedral and the Bazar, which I also enjoyed very much. I had read FSF: What is free software the week before. I was thrilled with copyleft. Ha. Such a good idea. And I totally get the difference between open source and free source. These are really important fundamental concepts and I’m glad that I made the decision to do all that reading rather than work on learning to code. In a perfect world I should have been able to do both, but due to the imperfect nature of my current existence, time was not abundant enough.
I’m not going to list the hours reading, but instead note that I spent many hours reading and going off on reading-connected tangents.  

## Week Seven (3/7 to 3/13)

From the reading for today I learned that Python does imperative programming. It works in steps and often changes the state of the program by introducing new variables and/or changing existing variables. Functional programs, on the other hand, avoid states as much as they can. This is a wild concept. Not sure how I picture this. If I understand correctly a functional program sees the paradigm as a problem and comes up with a solution. Solutions are functions “that pass values to one another.” I don’t see what values are as opposed to variables. What is the difference between variables in an imperative program and values in a functional program? 
In a functional program the question of the state of the program tends to be isolated. The functions, which pass values from one to another, seek to be predictable. These functions should always produce the same output if fed the same input. 
Object-oriented programming is a combination of imperative and functional programming. It designates functions that deal with specific states. Objects are a combination of state (or the data that describes the state) with the functions that act on the state. The object-oriented approach tells specific functions to only operate on specific pieces of data.

Hour 1: Oh man. I hadn’t been on the command line for a while and I went to files on the first level of my user if you see what I mean (I have to figure out where these files are from the front end) and opened software-design-lab/templates/journal.md to update my journal and found only the first two weeks. Oh argh. I wondered if I’d deleted most of my journal and was about to fetch and merge it from my repository but then thought maybe I should look on Desktop to see if it’s there and argh, voila, I have another software-design-lab in Desktop/projects where journal.md is updated. So I started removing files in the other software-design-lab folder with the rm command but then got a bit scared because I was removing a lot of stuff one by one (I’m scared of using rm –R). I think I’ll ask for help with deleting stuff. 

Hour 2: I read the homework (“An Introduction to Programming”), downloaded the zip file and put this file in Desktop/software-design-lab. I typed in the prompts and ran them but I don’t understand why I did what I did. 

Hour 3: Re-read An Introduction to Programming. I still don't understand. I feel very dull-witted. I'll hopefully have a eureka I can see the light moment in class. For now I'm putting this aside and going to do some soothing Learn Python the Hard Way. 

## Week Eight (3/14 to 3/20)

Wow. Week eight already. I'm turning over a new leaf. This week we will see many hours of hacking documented in this journal. 

Hour 1: I looked back over the exercises I've done in Learn Python the Hard Way to refresh my memory and decided to do ex13 again because I must have been tired when I did it; I don't think I absorbed much. I found that I didn't understand some of the terminology. I looked up sys with pydoc and see that sys is system-specific parameters. I understand that sys is a module, and that there are lots of different modular variations. In ex13 I use the sys command to import an argument variable to my script from the system-specific parameters. I am importing this from what Zed Shaw calls the Python feature set, which I understand is or is in the system-specific parameters, to my script, which is my code. My script is in my argument, which is my file named ex13.py. The command line - or, rather, Python 3.7 run through the command line - is the interpreter. The argv which I am importing holds the arguments I pass on to my script. I unpack it and assign argv to four variables. Ah, uh oh. Zed Shaw tells me that what he calls features are really called modules. I kind of understand why he does this. A feature is more imaginable than a module, which could be many things. But OK, got it, features are modules. 
I spent a disproportionate amount of time trying to figure out why my argument wouldn't run, googled the error I was getting, went back and realized I had forgotten to pass three variables to my argument when I ran my script. Duh. Anyway, now it's running and I understand much better what I'm doing than when I first did ex13. Just one thing though: a word in my ex13.py shows up with a red squiggly underline. When I hover I read Possible unbalanced tuple unpacking with sequence: left side has 4 label(s), right side has 0 value(s)pylint(unbalanced-tuple-unpacking). The argument runs anyway (am I right to talk about "running" my "argument"?) but I wonder why I get the red squiggly underline and what the explanation means.

Hour 2: did ex14. Love it! Super cool how I created an argument with variables and prompts and got input from a user (myself) with argv. Zed Shaw says that I should make sure I understand how he combined a """style multiline string with the {} format activator as the last print. I understand that he did it but I'm not sure what it does. I have to ask you what I'm doing. Did ex15. Wowee. I actually got Python to open a txt file! Super thrilling. This opens up a world of possibilities. I did pydoc open as ZS told me to, and my head is spinning with all the new concepts condensed into the brief pydoc explanation of what open does. 

Hour 3: Learn Python the Hard Way (LPTHW from now on) ex16. I need to remember that write takes a parameter of a string I want to write to a file. Ha! I read and wrote into a file from the command line! Ha! This is awesome. I can open files in the command line and alter them. I'm hacking. :) Looking back at the code I wrote, I'm not sure what target does. I know that I give a file a command by using the . (dot or period), the name of the command, and parameters, so when I write target.write(line1) I'm telling the target file (I think the target file is the file I opened when I ran ex16.py) to write line 1 of the file I just truncated. And target.write("\n") tells the target file to write a new line. After ex16 I did ex17, where I open a file and copy its contents to another file. To my delight it worked beautifully. I'm just a little confused because the first time I ran it the output file, which doesn't exist, is new_file.txt and the argument correctly returned False because it doesn't exist. When I tried running the code with another input file but the same output new_file.txt the argument said that True the file does exist. Hm. I have to go back over this. 

Hour 4: LPTHW ex18. Now Zed Shaw introduces us to functions. I think functions might not be exactly the same thing as modules after all. I did ex18 with no problem whatsoever. Then I did ex19. It won't run. Nothing happens. It drives me nuts. I went over it again and again, no syntax errors. I exited terminal and went back. It won't run. I did cat ex19.py and everything looks right. I googled the problem with ex19, haven't found an answer so far. 

Hour 5: I went to digital fellow office hours to ask for help with ex19.py. Digital fellows is packed today. So I couldn't get help from anyone because all the fellows are busy. I have to rush to class. 

## Week Nine (3/21 to 3/27)

I was supposed to recover from oral surgery in the four days following 3/14 and I suppose I did, but as I was doing so I got a big infection in the root of another tooth and it was really painful, but I thought it was the post-surgery trauma that was hurting and didn’t realize I had a massive infection until 3/25 when I went to the dentist for post-surgery follow-up. Due to this infection I have been finding it difficult to stay on top of things. The good news is that it’s over, gone, done with. My dentist extracted the infected tooth on 3/25 and I’ve been feeling myself again since then. 

This is my journal entry for last week. I’m sorry to be posting it late. Basically, all I did this past week was the SQL tutorial, which was a lot of fun; SQL seems somewhat intuitive when one gets used to its syntax, but at the same time it feels a bit clunky, maybe because it’s been around since the ‘70s. 

Hour 1: W3Schools Tutorial on SQL

Hour 2: W3Schools Tutorial on SQL

Hour 3: wrote the description of the static site I want developed (this was the assignment for this week) and sent it to you by email

Hour 4: figured out how to push my project description assignment to GitHub as a new .md file, and put it on GitHub

I’m afraid that was it for this week. I’ll have more to say in next week’s journal. 

## Week Ten (3/28 to 4/3)

This week I did some more exercises from Learn Python the Hard Way. I feel like I'm not totally getting it but I'm forging ahead hoping that there will be a eureka moment. 

Hour 1: LPTHW exx 20, 21, 22

Hour 2: LPTHW exx 23, 24, 25, 26

On Monday 4/1 Chris and I met to code together in my office at CCNY. We ended up working on the oral history app we’re developing for Thomas. It was a lot of fun and instructive, but we absolutely did not create anything we’ll be able to use. This is because we decided to build the app as a website with html and css. I know, funny approach. I had my doubts, and Chris had his, but after discussing what we understood Thomas wanted, we were itching to code so we went ahead and built a very simple website. It’s very simple so don’t expect anything wild. Here’s the code: https://github.com/Springle3152/software-design-lab/blob/master/oral-history/index.html 

Because Thomas had told us that the oral history app would serve to record the histories of people such as, for example, the owner of the local grocery store, Chris and I looked for pictures of grocery stores in the public domain and found the coolest, happiest picture ever and put it in the website. It still feels like magic when I create a super simple anything in code and then see it on a browser. 

We shared our work on GitHub and pledged to work from there. It would probably been easier but more pedestrian to share by email (I refuse to use Google docs or Google drive or Google anything if I can help it) because we’re not super familiar with GitHub yet, although I’m feeling very comfortable doing the things I know how to do. Thomas and I both need to be contributors to the oral-history file I created in my software-design-lab repository, but he lost his internet connection, so we put that on hold.

Hour 3: worked on wireframe for oral history app with Chris

Hour 4: built prototype of website for oral history app with Chris

Hour 5: pushed files to my software-design-lab repository on GitHub, planned next steps for developing the oral history app, added next steps in a notes.md file, and lost internet connection

Hour 6: tried to get Chris connected to the internet. Gave up. Decided to go to a digital branding workshop at the GC. Had a subway adventure and got there 20 minutes late but the workshop was awesome.

Hour 7: tried to figure out how we could use SQL to create user accounts and/or upload oral histories on app (website now, but we have a growing suspicion that this is not the way to go).

## Week Eleven (4/4 to 4/10)

Hour 1: I started doing the your Creating APIs with Python and Flask tutorial. The first stumbling block I ran into was an error in the Library of Congress database. I pasted 

http://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/search/pages/results/?format=json&proxtext=fire

into my browser and got the following unexpected error: “Chronicling America has encountered an unexpected error while processing your request. The details of this error have been logged, and our troubleshooting specialists will be notified. We apologize for any inconvenience.” I wondered whether fire was a hot subject right now and had consequently been censored by the Trump administration. To find out, I tried 

http://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/search/pages/results/?format=json&proxtext=wall

I got the same error. I tried protext=great and protext=love (who would dare censor “love”?!) and came to the conclusion that the error was not a case of spurious underhanded censorship. I looked closely at the url that was giving me the error and compared it with the url in the tutorial. I realized that my browser was changing http to https. This must be why I’m getting the error, I thought. I looked up http and https and learned that the former is hypertext transfer protocol without a layer of security, and the latter is hypertext transfer protocol secure, which means that all communications between my browser and the website are encrypted. Damn. (at the moment I dislike encryption because I feel like my language is being taken away from me. I was recently spoken rudely to by a man in an Apple support forum because I said I was backing up my computer without encrypting. But that’s another story.) As I try to figure out a way over the stumbling block that’s stopping me from following the API with Python and Flask tutorial, I continue to think that Chronicling America is giving me an error because it uses https instead of http (maybe at the time you created the tutorial it used http). I learned that I can create a website which uses http or https, as I choose, and that I can also create a redirect that switches from https to http in my website, but if I understand right I can’t turn someone else’s website from https to http. 

Hour 2: I decided I’d try to sort of replicate what your tutorial asks me to do with the Chronicling America database but using a different http database. I searched for http websites. I couldn’t find any because Firefox keeps redirecting me to https (so does Safari and Chrome). Or the pages I’m visiting all choose https. I’m no longer sure whether http turns into https because the websites I’m trying to visit don’t do http or if it’s my browser that doesn’t do http because it’s trying to protect me. Eeeargh. I haven’t gotten very far in the tutorial. 

I found this but I think it’s a joke: http://neverssl.com

I did some more research and see that it’s my browser that’s automatically switching me to https. I found a thread in the Mozilla support forum where someone explains how to disable https by typing about:config and toggling browser.urlbar.autofill from true to false. I’m going to do this, but I think I’ll make another unencrypted backup copy of all my files just in case I open my doors to multitudinous evil invaders rising up from the deep vortices of cyber hell. 

Hour 3: I made an unencrypted backup copy of my mac and then in Firefox used about:config to toggle the browser.urlbar.autofill from true to false. I closed my browser, reopened it, and pasted http://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/search/pages/results/?format=json&proxtext=fire
in the location bar. I was redirected to https://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/search/pages/results/?format=json&proxtext=fire
I reckon that Library of Congress doesn’t do http anymore. I got the unexpected error again. I have no idea whether the error has anything to do with encryption, but I’m glad I followed my hunch because it got me thinking about http and https. I don’t know why Chronicling America doesn’t return files with fire to my protext=fire query. The problem might be with the format=json query; Chronicling America (or Library of Congress) might be having trouble returning html as JSON. 

Eeeeeeh I’m such a jerk. I just tried searching for fire by typing fire in the Chronicling America search bar. I got the same error. Argh. I tried typing great, and wall, and New York for a little variety, and love, in the search bar. Unexpected error every time. 

On the basis of my methodical but unsuccessful attempts to return data on fire from Chronicling America, I conclude that Chronicling America has got a bug.

Hour 4: I decided to try the parameter query in another database. I chose the British Library database of 19th century British newspapers, which I accessed through the NYPL. I typed 

find.galegroup.com.i.ezproxy.nypl.org/bncn/start.do?prodId=BNCN&userGroupName=nypl/?format=json&proxtext=fire

and nothing much happened. I didn’t get an error, which is nice. Hm. I decided to try another database because the query might not work in a redirect to Gale (I’m guessing wildly, I know).
I decided to try in an archive that belongs to the NYPL. I chose the recently added Lou Reed papers 1958-2015. The url is 

http://archives.nypl.org/mus/24078

I added the query parameters as so:

http://archives.nypl.org/mus/24078/?format=json&proxtext=fire

it worked! It worked! Wow, yay, ha! I could hardly believe my eyes when I saw the html returned to JSON. This is super exciting. Now to figure out what to do with it. 

I checked to make sure fire is in the JSON I was returned. It is. We learn from the following sentence that “Pass Through Fire” is the title of a proof of a book Reed was working on:

"There are additional proofs present for Reed's books, including <span class=\"title\">Between Thought and Expression</span>, <span class=\"title\">Emotions in Action</span>, <span class=\"title\">Pass Through Fire</span>,"

This is the only record with fire that I found in the Lou Reed papers. This surprises me intuitively, but I will not explore further because I was only looking for fire to see if I could collect data using an API, and I could and I did so I’m happy.


## Week Twelve (4/11 to 4/17)
