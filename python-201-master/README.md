# Python 201

This workshop takes a step back from Python syntax to look at high-level ways of solving problems with code and managing complexity. We'll create different solutions to the same problem using three different programming paradigms: imperative, functional, and object-oriented. We'll also consider concepts related to complexity such as modularity and managing state.
